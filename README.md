## Assigment 5 - Randomized Quicksort vs Deterministic Quicksort

In order to execute the experiment and generate the data for the results you can run the code using the following:

```
python3 assignment_5.py
```

This will run the deterministic and randomized quicksort algorithms on various input data sizes (1000, 10000, 100000 elements) on various input data types (random, sorted, reversed sorted, repeated random). This will allow us to empirically compare the performance of these two algorithsm on varying data sizes and types.

I have captured the results in a file named `results.txt` from the experiment I ran with my implementation. The analysis of my findings is documented in the report for this assignment in `Assignment-5.pdf`.
